## 📌 Project Description

The **Weather API Client** is a Java-based console application that allows users to fetch and display real-time weather information by making HTTP requests to external weather APIs (such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherStack, or others). This utility demonstrates how to integrate third-party APIs using HTTP requests in Java, parse the JSON responses, and present them in a human-readable format.

This project was built to provide developers with a hands-on example of how to consume RESTful web services in Java using standard libraries. It focuses on clean code, efficient API interaction, and modular structure. The client accepts user input, constructs API request URLs dynamically, handles HTTP connections, reads the response, and parses key weather data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, weather description, and more.

This application is ideal for beginners learning API integration in Java or developers who want a reusable utility to embed weather data into their Java applications or tools. Its modular design makes it easy to extend with more features such as error handling, caching, multi-city support, graphical interface integration, or advanced forecast data handling.

Whether you're building a dashboard, mobile backend, command-line utility, or even a smart home controller, this weather client can serve as a solid foundation.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

### 👨‍💻 Programming Language
- **Java SE (Standard Edition)**: The application is developed entirely in Java, utilizing Java's standard classes for networking and I/O.

### 🔗 APIs
- **Weather REST API** (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, WeatherStack): A third-party service is used to retrieve live weather information based on the city or coordinates.

### 🧰 Java Libraries and Packages
- **java.net.HttpURLConnection**: For making HTTP GET requests to fetch weather data from the API endpoint.
- **java.io.InputStream / BufferedReader**: For reading the response stream from the API.
- **org.json / com.google.gson (if applicable)**: For parsing JSON responses and extracting weather information. If not already used, integration is recommended.

### 💻 IDE (Optional)
- IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, or VS Code with Java extensions can be used for editing, running, and debugging.

### ✅ Java Version
- Java 8 or higher is recommended to ensure compatibility with newer APIs and JSON handling libraries.

## 🌍 Where This is Used

The Weather API Client can be utilized in various practical scenarios and serves multiple domains:

### 1. 🔎 Educational Use
- Ideal for students learning how to consume APIs in Java.
- Demonstrates HTTP request handling, JSON parsing, and exception management.
- Provides real-world context for working with external services.

### 2. 📱 App Integration
- Acts as the backend module for mobile apps displaying weather data.
- Can be plugged into Android applications using native Java components.

### 3. 🖥️ Desktop Applications
- Useful in desktop weather widgets or real-time dashboards built with Java Swing, JavaFX, or other UI frameworks.

### 4. 📈 Data Logging Systems
- Can be configured to fetch weather data at regular intervals and log it for analysis or reporting purposes.
- Great for agricultural, environmental, or logistics-related software.

### 5. 🔧 IoT & Automation
- Supports smart home systems where local devices need to adjust based on real-time weather (e.g., smart blinds, HVAC systems).

### 6. 🌐 Web Backends (Microservices)
- Serves as a microservice in larger web applications for real-time weather updates.
- Easily deployable as a REST client in Spring Boot or other Java frameworks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔑 Prerequisites
- Obtain an API key from a weather data provider like [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine.
- Internet connection to fetch data from the API.
